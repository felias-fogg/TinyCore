# Minimum functionality tests

The tests in this folder each check one particular basic functionality. They are organized in folders, where each folder contains at least a target sketch, which needs to be flashed to the target chip, and perhaps a host sketch for an ATmega328P (Uno, Mega, or Nano). Further, there will be a generic description of how to wire up the two boards and how to run the test protocol. 

- `digitalrw`: Tests `digitalRead` and `digitalWrite` on all pins
- `analogw`: Tests `analogWrite` on all supported pins, one by one, trying out different values.
- `analogr`: Tests `analogRead` on all supported pins, one by one, trying 0V and Vcc.
- `analogv`: Tests `analogRead` on all supported pins in parallel, printing the measured voltage. 
- `serial`: Tests serial I/O.
- `wire`: Tests to check I2C master and slave capabilities.
- `spi`: Tests to check SPI master and slave capabilities.
- `neo`: Tests to check the neopixel functionality.
- `servo`: Tests to check servo functionality.

🟢 = Works
🔴 = Does not work
🟡 = Partially works
⚫️ = Not present / Not implemented
⚪️ = Untested

ATtiny26:

- analogWrite: PWM does not work on either PWM pin (9 and 11)
- Wire Master & Slave, SPI master, Neopixel: Not enough memory for test sketch
- Servo: Compilation error

ATtiny85:

- SPI master does not work

ATtiny167:

- TWI slave: Stops after a few interactions and is stuck in waiting for the serial output buffer to become empty (same behavior as in the 1.5.2 core)

- SPI master: Stops in the middle of the test. Perhaps a similar problem as above.

ATtiny861:

- SPI master: Message is not received by slave 

ATtiny43U:

- Servo: Compiler message: Not supported
- Wire slave: Does not start
- SPI master: No transfer (in 1.5.2 core: compilation error)

ATtiny828:

- <s>Neopixel does not work on: 6,7,8,9,11, ...? Does not work on 1.5.2 either on pin 11, even if I set Neopixel port to PORTB</s>  *was the board hardware* 
- Wire Master & Salve use apparently my bitbang I2C lib SoftI2CMaster and fail with a compilation error
- <s>Reading analog values: Wildly wrong and huge differences. Even when measuring individually, the values are way off (with the 1.5.2 core, it is the same; maybe it is a problem with the sample?)  </s> *Was probably the board!*
- analogWrite: Does not work at all. Under the 1.5.2 core it works for pins 20-22 (but not for 16). This still holds for the new hardware setup.
