# Minimum functionality tests

The tests in this folder each check one particular basic functionality. They are organized in folders, where each folder contains at least a target sketch, which needs to be flashed to the target chip, and perhaps a host sketch for an ATmega328P (Uno, Mega, or Nano). Further, there will be a generic description of how to wire up the two boards and how to run the test protocol. 

- `digitalrw`: Tests `digitalRead` and `digitalWrite` on all pins
- `analogw`: Tests `analogWrite` on all supported pins, one by one, trying out different values.
- `analogr`: Tests `analogRead` on all supported pins, one by one, trying 0V and Vcc.
- `analogv`: Tests `analogRead` on all supported pins in parallel, printing the measured voltage. 
- `serial`: Tests serial I/O.
- `wire`: Tests to check I2C master and slave capabilities.
- `spi`: Tests to check SPI master and slave capabilities.
- `neo`: Tests to check the neopixel functionality.
- `servo`: Tests to check servo functionality.

🟢 = Works
🔴 = Does not work
🟡 = Partially works
⚫️ = Not present / Not implemented
⚪️ = Untested

ATtiny26:

- Wire slave (with serial removed) - data is being transfered, but is incorrect
- Neopixel: Not enough memory for test sketch
- Servo: Compilation error (Timer1 is a 8-bit timer/counter, not a 16-bit one)

ATtiny167:

- TWI slave: Stops after a few interactions and is stuck in waiting for the serial output buffer to become empty (same behavior as in the 1.5.2 core). Still the same problem (Apr 04, 2025).

ATtiny43U:

- Wire slave: Does not start
- SPI master: No transfer (in 1.5.2 core: compilation error)

ATtiny828:

- **Note**: When PD3 (D27) is used as an input (also for TWI/SPI slave clock), WDT has to be activated!

ATtiny4313:

- TWI slave: Stops after a few interactions. Possibly the same issue as with the ATtiny87/167

ATtiny841:

- TWI slave: Slave mode compiles but doesn't work. It works with ATtinyCore 1.5.2. However, the Wire library bundled with ATtinyCore 1.5.2 does not work with TinyCore. So maybe this is related to the initialization of the core?
